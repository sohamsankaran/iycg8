          <h3>Welcome to the G8.</h3>

<p>For hundreds of years, the countries that comprise the Group of Eight have utterly dominated the world, socially, politically, and economically, 14% of the human population ruling over the rest.
But the once undisputed masters of the universe are in trouble. 
Their economies lie in shambles, overtaken by those they once called barbarians, their armies, routinely defeated by hordes of militants who will stop at nothing to see them vanquished forever. 
Once called the cabinet of the world, the G8 may now be fighting for its very survival, just as they are needed most.
As lumbering giants turn underdogs, allegiances change at the drop of a hat, and the world spins deeper and deeper into the abyss of anarchy, the G8 alone has the power to restore balance before time runs out...</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
